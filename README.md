Lean Copilot: LLMs as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean
==========================================================

Lean Copilot allows large language models (LLMs) to be used in Lean for proof automation, e.g., suggesting tactics/premises and searching for proofs. You can use our built-in models from [LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) or bring your own models that run either locally (w/ or w/o GPUs) or on the cloud.

## Requirements

* Supported platforms: Linux, macOS and Windows WSL
* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
* Optional (recommended if you have a [CUDA-enabled GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)): CUDA and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
* Required for building Lean Copilot itself (rather than a downstream package): CMake >= 3.7 and a C++17 compatible compiler

## Using Lean Copilot in Your Project

:warning: Your project must use a Lean version of at least `lean4:v4.3.0-rc2`.

### Adding Lean Copilot as a Dependency

1. Add the package configuration option `moreLinkArgs := #["-L./.lake/packages/LeanCopilot/.lake/build/lib", "-lctranslate2"]` to lakefile.lean. Also add the following line:
```lean
require LeanCopilot from git "https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanCopilot.git" @ "v1.0.0"
```
3. Run `lake update LeanCopilot`
4. Run `lake exe LeanCopilot/download` to download the built-in models from Hugging Face to `~/.cache/lean_copilot/`
5. Run `lake build`

[Here](https://github.com/yangky11/lean4-example/blob/LeanCopilot-demo) is an example of a Lean package depending on Lean Copilot. If you have problems building the project, our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), [build.sh](scripts/build.sh) or [build_example.sh](scripts/build_example.sh) may be helpful.


### Getting Started with Lean Copilot


#### Tactic Suggestion

After `import LeanCopilot`, you can use the tactic `suggest_tactics` to generate tactic suggestions. You can click on any of the suggested tactics to use it in the proof.

You can provide a prefix (e.g., `simp`) to constrain the generated tactics:

#### Proof Search

The tactic `search_proof` combines LLM-generated tactics with [aesop](https://github.com/leanprover-community/aesop) to search for multi-tactic proofs. When a proof is found, you can click on it to insert it into the editor.

#### Premise Selection

The `select_premises` tactic retrieves a list of potentially useful premises. Currently, it uses the retriever in [LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) to select premises from a fixed snapshot of Lean and [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/3ce43c18f614b76e161f911b75a3e1ef641620ff).

#### Running LLMs

You can also run the inference of any LLMs in Lean, which can be used to build customized proof automation or other LLM-based applications (not limited to theorem proving). It's possible to run arbitrary models either locally or remotely (see [Bring Your Own Model](#bring-your-own-model)).

## Advanced Usage

### Model APIs

### Bring Your Own Model

### Tactic APIs

mul_left_comm needs to be imported from Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Basic.lean.

```
@[to_additive]
theorem mul_left_comm : âˆ€ a b c : G, a * (b * c) = b * (a * c)
```

Coming soon.
